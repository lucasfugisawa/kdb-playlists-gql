## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL as its database. A Docker Compose file is provided to easily set up the database.

### Starting the Database

To start the PostgreSQL database, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start a PostgreSQL container with the following configuration:
- **Database name**: kdb_playlists
- **Username**: postgres
- **Password**: postgres
- **Port**: 5432 (mapped to host)

### Stopping the Database

To stop the PostgreSQL container, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To stop the container and remove all data (volumes), run:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
